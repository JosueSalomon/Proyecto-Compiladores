Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> NUMBER CONVERSION END

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CONVERSION           : 1
END                  : 1
NUMBER               : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . NUMBER CONVERSION END

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2

    expression                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .



state 2

    (1) expression -> NUMBER . CONVERSION END

    CONVERSION      shift and go to state 3


state 3

    (1) expression -> NUMBER CONVERSION . END

    END             shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (1) expression -> NUMBER CONVERSION END .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> NUMBER CONVERSION END .)
